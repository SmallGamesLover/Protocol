# 2D Character Movement Component — Design Document
> Version: 2.0.0 | Project: Protocol

---

## Foundation

**Rigidbody Type:** Kinematic Rigidbody2D. The character moves via `MovePosition`; the physics engine handles collisions but does not control movement on its own. No depenetration, no tunneling, fully predictable behavior.

**Collision Detection Mode:** Discrete. Sufficient due to the capped maximum fall speed.

**Ground Check:** Ground contact is detected via `Physics2D.OverlapBox` just below the character's feet (or `Physics2D.Raycast` downward from the collider). The result is used to switch sub-states (Jump/Fall/Idle/Walk) and for coyote time.

**One-way Platforms:** Unity's `PlatformEffector2D` only works out of the box with Dynamic Rigidbody. With Kinematic, manual handling is required: on collision with a one-way platform, check the vertical movement direction — if the character is moving upward, the collision is ignored; if moving downward or standing still, the collision stops movement. Allocate dedicated time for implementation and testing.

## FSM Hierarchy (HFSM)

The movement component is built on a two-level hierarchical finite state machine. The HFSM is implemented by **reusing the same `StateMachine<TState>` class** on both levels — no dedicated HFSM class is needed.

### Why HFSM Instead of a Flat FSM

Five movement sub-states (Idle, Walk, Run, Jump, Fall) share a single common outward transition — dodge. In a flat FSM, dodge would need to be registered from each one: Idle→Dodge, Walk→Dodge, Run→Dodge, Jump→Dodge, Fall→Dodge. Every new sub-state adds yet another transition. HFSM solves this: dodge is defined once at the top level (WalkingState→DodgeState), and all sub-states inherit it automatically because the top-level FSM only sees "WalkingState", not its internals.

### Top Level
Switches between high-level states:

| State | Description | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `WalkingState` | Ground and airborne character physics. Owns an internal sub-state FSM | Prototype |
| `DodgeState` | Horizontal dodge | Prototype |
| `FlyingState` | Airborne physics without gravity | Post-prototype |

### Bottom Level — WalkingState's Internal FSM

WalkingState owns an instance of `StateMachine<IState>` and manages its sub-states independently. All transitions between sub-states are registered in the WalkingState constructor via `AddTransition()` — the entire transition map is visible in one place. Sub-states are unaware of the top level's existence.

| Sub-state | Entry Condition | Weapon Accuracy |
|---|---|---|
| `Idle` | No horizontal input, grounded | Maximum |
| `Walk` | Horizontal input without Shift, grounded | Medium |
| `Run` | Horizontal input + Shift, grounded | Minimum |
| `Jump` | After jump, `velocity.y ≥ 0` | — |
| `Fall` | `velocity.y < 0` or walked off an edge | — |

### Entering WalkingState and ResolveSubState

On entering `WalkingState` (first launch or return after DodgeState), `ResolveSubState()` is called — a method that determines the initial sub-state based on current conditions: ground contact, horizontal input presence, vertical velocity. **WalkingState does not default to Idle** — if a dodge ended mid-air, WalkingState enters Fall immediately.

## WalkingConfig (ScriptableObject)

Configuration for `WalkingState`. Used by both the player and enemies.

### Horizontal Movement

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `walkSpeed` | float | Maximum walk speed |
| `runSpeed` | float | Maximum run speed |
| `acceleration` | float | Rate of reaching target speed |
| `deceleration` | float | Rate of slowing down (higher than acceleration for a sense of control) |

### Jump

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `jumpHeight` | float | Desired jump height in units |
| `timeToApex` | float | Time to reach maximum height in seconds |
| `timeToDescent` | float | Time to fall from maximum height to the ground in seconds |
| `lowJumpMultiplier` | float | Gravity multiplier when the jump button is released before the apex |
| `maxFallSpeed` | float | Maximum fall speed cap |

### Computed Values

Computed from config parameters, not set manually:

```
gravity        = -2 * jumpHeight / timeToApex²
jumpVelocity   =  2 * jumpHeight / timeToApex
fallMultiplier = (timeToApex / timeToDescent)²
```

### Responsiveness

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `coyoteTime` | float | Time after walking off an edge during which a jump is still available. Typical values: 0.08–0.15 sec |
| `jumpBufferTime` | float | Time during which a jump input is remembered before landing. Typical values: 0.1–0.15 sec |

> **Important:** Coyote time only activates on transition from a grounded state (Idle/Walk/Run) to Fall (walked off an edge). After a jump, coyote time is not active — otherwise the player gets an unintended "double jump": jumped → started falling → coyote time still active → jumped again.

## DodgeConfig (ScriptableObject)

Configuration for `DodgeState`.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `dodgeDistance` | float | Dodge distance in units |
| `dodgeTime` | float | Time to cover the dodge distance in seconds |

### Computed Value

```
dodgeSpeed = dodgeDistance / dodgeTime
```

### DodgeState Behavior

- Vertical velocity is reset to zero on entry — an airborne dodge acts as a "hover" with horizontal movement
- Horizontal movement is strictly in the dodge direction
- Blocks shooting and reloading for the entire dodge duration
- Available from any `WalkingState` sub-state including `Jump` and `Fall` — the transition is defined at the top HFSM level
- On completion, returns control to `WalkingState`, which determines the correct sub-state via `ResolveSubState()`

### Interfaces

| Interface | Contract | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `IState` | `OnEnter()`, `OnExit()` | State lifecycle. Implemented by all states |
| `ITickable` | `Tick(float deltaTime)` | Per-frame update. Does not inherit `IState` — an independent contract, applicable beyond FSM |

### StateMachine\<TState\>
Generic FSM responsible only for transitions. Unaware of `Tick` — ticking is the owner's responsibility:

```csharp
// CharacterMover2D (FixedUpdate):
_topFsm.EvaluateTransitions();
if (_topFsm.CurrentState is ITickable tickable)
    tickable.Tick(deltaTime);
```

### CharacterMover2D
An independent component, unaware of the input source. Whether it is driven by the player's FSM or enemy AI is none of its concern.

**Public Commands:**

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `Move(Vector2 direction)` | Horizontal movement. Vector2 allows using the component in `FlyingState`. WalkingState uses only `direction.x` and ignores `direction.y` |
| `Jump()` | Jump |
| `Dodge(Vector2 direction)` | Dodge in the specified direction |

### WalkingConfig
ScriptableObject with parameters for `WalkingState`. Tweakable in the Inspector during Play Mode without recompilation. Used by both the player and enemies — different instances with different values.

### DodgeConfig
ScriptableObject with parameters for `DodgeState`. Tweakable in the Inspector during Play Mode without recompilation.

### CollisionSlideResolver
A utility class with a single responsibility: takes a movement vector and a collision surface normal, returns an adjusted slide vector along the surface. Unaware of who calls it — used by both `WalkingState` and `FlyingState`.
